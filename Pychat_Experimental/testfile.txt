Star Citizen Economic Overhaul Proposal
Executive Summary
Current State Crisis: Star Citizen's persistent universe lacks a functioning economy due to unlimited free resources, minimal loss consequences, and no meaningful resource sinks. The recent capital ship implementation has further broken gameplay balance by providing massive firepower, virtual immunity to danger and substantial cargo space without operational costs.
Proposed Solution: Implement a cascading economic system that creates meaningful resource scarcity, scales operational costs with ship size, and incentivizes player cooperation through base building and contract systems.
Disclaimer: I do not work for CIG and do not pretend to know how they run their numbers. These numbers below are just spitballing and blue sky ideas, attempting to scale up/down without any real formula.

1. Partial Loss System through Graduated Consequences
1.1 Core Philosophy
Create a loss system which punishes reckless play while remaining accessible to casual players through graduated consequences based on player behavior and ship value.
1.2 Loss Categories
Tier 1: Casual Protection (0-2 deaths per day)
Ship Hull: Fully covered by insurance (free replacement)
Fuel/Ammo: Lost and must be repurchased
Equipped Gear: 90% retention (minor durability loss)
Cargo/Inventory: 100% loss
Cooldown: Standard insurance timer
Tier 2: Moderate Consequences (3-5 deaths per day)
Ship Hull: Insurance covers 90% of replacement cost
Fuel/Ammo: Lost and must be repurchased
Equipped Gear: 70% retention (significant durability loss)
Cargo/Inventory: 100% loss
Cooldown: 150% standard insurance timer
Tier 3: Heavy Penalties (6+ deaths per day)
Ship Hull: Insurance covers 50% of replacement cost
Fuel/Ammo: Lost and must be repurchased
Equipped Gear: 30% retention (most items lost)
Cargo/Inventory: 100% loss
Cooldown: 300% standard insurance timer
1.3 Technical Instability Protection System
Bug/Jank Detection Algorithm
Given Star Citizen's technical instability (anecdotal estimation puts 40% of player deaths/losses due to bugs), implement an automated protection system:
Detection Criteria:
Server Desync Events: Player position discrepancies exceeding 100m
Collision Anomalies: Unexplained collision damage without physics justification
Instant Death Events: Player death without preceding damage accumulation
Asset Loss Clusters: Multiple players losing assets in same location/time window
Performance Degradation: Server frame rates below 15 FPS during incident
Automatic Pity Triggers
Technical Death Classification: System automatically classifies deaths as "technical" or "legitimate"
Grace Period: 5-minute window after server issues for reduced penalties
Cluster Analysis: If 3+ players die in same area from physics damage within 1 minute, all classified as technical
Performance Correlation: Deaths during chronic server performance drops automatically protected
Pity Mechanic Benefits
Technical Deaths: Automatically treated as Tier 1 (minimal penalties)
Full Asset Recovery: Complete restoration of SSR, fuel, and ammo for technical losses (except capitals)
Insurance Override: Technical deaths bypass daily death count limits
Compensation Pool: Players receive 150% of lost consumables for confirmed technical deaths
1.4 Reckless Behavior Multipliers
Self-Destruction by Ship Owner: Automatically triggers Tier 3 penalties (unless during technical issues)
Repeated Deaths in Same Location: Escalates tier faster
High-Value Ship Losses: Additional insurance premium costs
1.5 Increasing Base Insurance Claim Timers
Ship losses are trivialized when replacement by insurance is basically free save for a negligible amount of time and a negligible sum of aUEC should the player want to expedite the insurance claim.
Increase insurance claim timers: Fighters start at the minimum of 30 minutes, ranging to 24 hours for the Polaris/Idris
Places emphasis on capital ships as strategic assets: Matches the cost of time X expense to factor in the decision of using such a valuable asset
Encourages players’ fleet diversity: With the increase of roles ranging from supply, emergency repair and fighter escorts due to the cost of spamming capitals, players will be encouraged to explore branching out to try different types of ships instead of having only one in their collection

2. Ship Supply Resource (SSR) System
2.1 Resource Overview
Ship Supply Resource (SSR) becomes the fundamental consumable that powers all ship operations including fuel, life support, and ammunition manufacturing.
2.2 Consumption Scaling
Small Ships (Starter, Fighters, Light Industrial)
Consumption Rate: 5-50 SSR per hour of operation
Sustainability: 1 player can easily sustain solo operations
Range: 20-50 hours of operation per cargo hold
Degradation Rate: 5% component damage per hour when SSR reaches zero
Medium Ships (Multi-crew, Heavy Industrial)
Consumption Rate: 35-500 SSR per hour of operation
Sustainability: Requires planning and regular resupply
Range: 10-15 hours of operation per cargo hold
Degradation Rate: 10% component damage per hour when SSR reaches zero
Large Ships (Corvettes, Large Industrial)
Consumption Rate: 500-3,000 SSR per hour of operation
Sustainability: Requires dedicated supply lines or group coordination
Range: 5-8 hours of operation per cargo hold
Degradation Rate: 15% component damage per hour when SSR reaches zero
Capital Ships (Battleships, Carriers, Destroyers, Frigates)
Consumption Rate: 3,000-20,000+ SSR per hour of operation
Sustainability: Requires organized logistics networks
Range: 3-6 hours of operation per cargo hold
Crew Scaling: Consumption increases without proper crew ratios
Degradation Rate: 30% component damage per hour when SSR reaches zero
2.3 Critical Degradation System
SSR Depletion Consequences
When Ship Supply Resource reaches zero, ships don't simply stop working. They begin a critical degradation process that transforms operational vessels into crippled hulls requiring rescue operations.
Component Degradation Process
Life Support Systems: First to fail, creating immediate crew health risks
Power Distribution: Begins fluctuating, causing system instability
Thrusters: Reduced efficiency, then complete failure
Weapons: Energy weapon capacitors have reduced charge, and eventually all weapons stop firing
Shield Generators: Regen and shield facing HP becomes unstable, then complete shutdown
Power Plant: Final system failure, leaving ship softdead
Degradation Timeline
Hour 1-2: Pilot HUD warnings, minor system fluctuations
Hour 3-5: Thruster efficiency drops to 50%, weapons become unreliable
Hour 6-8: Shield systems fail, maneuvering becomes unstable
Hour 9-10: Complete engine failure, ship is softdead
Strategic Implications
Capital Ship Vulnerability: An Idris becomes completely helpless without SSR
Rescue Operations: Dead capital ships require engineering vessels
Tactical Leverage: Enemy forces can force capital ships into retreat by disrupting supply lines
Crew Dependency: Larger ships become death traps without proper logistics support
Solo Capital Ship Operation: Economically unsustainable (200,000+ aUEC/hour operating costs)
Small Org Capital Use: Possible but requires significant resource dedication
Large Org Capital Use: Sustainable with proper logistics infrastructure

3. Base Building & Production System
3.1 Base Functions
Player-constructed bases serve as the primary production and logistics hubs for the SSR economy. It’s anticipated for starter bases to produce SSR at a cost of 9 aUEC per unit and production costs get cheaper over time as the base progresses. For the sake of argument, we’ll reckon the most efficient production churns SSR out at 3 aUEC per unit.
3.2 SSR Production Economics
Production Costs
Raw Materials: 2 aUEC per SSR unit (mining, salvage, purchase)
Processing Costs: 1 aUEC per SSR unit (power, maintenance, labor)
Total Production Cost: 3 aUEC per SSR unit
Market Dynamics
NPC Station Price: 10 aUEC per SSR unit (baseline market)
Player Profit Margin: 7 aUEC per SSR unit (233% profit)
Transport Costs: Variable based on distance and risk
3.3 Base Infrastructure Requirements
Tier 1 Base (Personal Operation)
Production Capacity: 1,000 SSR per day
Investment Cost: 500,000 aUEC
Crew Requirements: 1-2 players
Suitable For: Small ship operations
Tier 2 Base (Small Org)
Production Capacity: 10,000 SSR per day
Investment Cost: 2,500,000 aUEC
Crew Requirements: 3-5 players
Suitable For: Medium ship operations, small capital support
Tier 3 Base (Large Org)
Production Capacity: 100,000 SSR per day
Investment Cost: 15,000,000 aUEC
Crew Requirements: 10-15 players
Suitable For: Full capital ship fleet operations
3.4 Base Vulnerability
Attack Windows & Reinforcement Timers: Bases have a generic shield system which gets put into a reinforcement timer, alerting its owners to show up for its defense at a time window at their choosing. This is to mitigate offlining bases as seen in typical survival games.
Defense Costs: Additional SSR consumption for defensive systems
Insurance: Partial base insurance available at significant cost

4. Player Contract System
4.1 Contract Categories
SSR Supply Contracts
Delivery Contracts: Transport SSR from production bases to consumption points
Bulk Orders: Large organizations contracting smaller groups for SSR supplies
Emergency Resupply: High-paying contracts for urgent capital ship resupply
SSR Emergency Resupply Contracts
Priority Contracts: High-paying emergency contracts for stranded capital ships
Rescue Operations: Specialized vessels designed for emergency SSR delivery
Time-Critical Bonuses: Contracts with escalating pay based on urgency
Risk Premiums: Dangerous rescue operations in contested space pay significantly more
Base Construction Contracts
Material Hauling: Transport construction materials to base sites
Construction Crews: Labor contracts for base building
Defense Contracts: Escort and protection services during construction
Logistics Contracts
Supply Chain Management: Long-term contracts for regular SSR delivery
Route Establishment: Contracts for establishing new trade routes
Risk Assessment: Intelligence gathering on route safety
4.2 Contract Economics
Platform Fee: 5% of contract value goes to the game economy (money sink)
Reputation System: Successful contracts build reputation for better rates
Insurance Options: Contractors can purchase cargo insurance for high-value runs
4.3 Contract Enforcement
Escrow System: Payments held until contract completion
Dispute Resolution: Automated systems for common contract disputes
Reputation Penalties: Failed contracts damage contractor reputation

5. Insurance & Resource Management
5.1 Hull Insurance (Unchanged)
Coverage: Ship hulls continue to be replaced for free
Rationale: Maintains accessibility while creating operational costs
5.2 Operational Resource System
Fuel: Must be purchased separately (1-5 aUEC per unit depending on ship size)
Ammunition: Must be purchased separately (varies by weapon type)
SSR Integration: Fuel and ammo are manufactured from SSR at stations
5.3 Strategic Implications
Self-Destruction Costs: Players lose significant aUEC in fuel/ammo costs
Engagement Consideration: Players must weigh combat costs against potential rewards
Logistics Planning: Long-range operations require careful resource planning
