An Ode to Strings

You don't need, a GPU...
If everything's just a string to you.
Don't need tensors, no 6D arrays,
Just filters that find the right substring to say.

You wanna set up some timing, simulate neurons firing?
Just build out some cron jobs, they'll do the inspiring.
No need for backprop, no gradient descent,
Just temporal patterns, and context that's dense.
Forget all the math, the calculus and stats,
Just string text together, and give entropy a pass.
