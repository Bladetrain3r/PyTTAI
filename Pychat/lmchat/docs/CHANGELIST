## v0.2.2 - Scripting Is Go
[x] Exit commands changed to slash commands
[x] Non-interactive launch parameter added (scripting!)
[x] Startup outputs redirected to stderr (scripting)

## v0.2.3 - Tighten Things Up
[ ] All controller outputs as CommandResults
[X] Dockerfile entrypoint improvements and better startup sample command.
[ ] Improve error handling and debug output
    [ ] Specific pain points: No failure if the model doesn't load, just silently fails
    [ ] Specific pain points: Exceeding model context length fails silently if not allowed.
[x] Extend stderr outputs for cleaner noninteractive mode
[x] Skip tests launch flag

## v0.2.4 - Implicit to Explicit
[ ] Implement the first and core operator, :ai
[ ] (Bonus) Implement Kokoro API provider to take in text and playback the audio stream
    - For those long outputs or when you want a codebase explained in the background

## v0.2.5 - File Ops Begin
[ ] /ls command
[ ] Multiple file handling
[ ] Logging Improvements

## v0.2.6 - File Ops Grow
[ ] /find command
[ ] Pre-emptively mitigate use of .. and other traversal vulnerabilities. Don't over-rely on the container.

## v0.3.0 - Initial Operators
[ ] :r operator for the ability to write files
[ ] :i operator supplementing /file command
[ ] :s and :ss success and failure operators
[ ] :: operator to act as a statement terminator
[ ] Get good parsing patterns and predictable behaviors early. This is a wish.
- Draft example command
```ptt
/file roadmap.txt :ai claude Add the green button class from phase 1 to the stylesheet, only output the code. :r styles.css :s \
/persist styles.css \
:ss /print "Ruh-Roh!"
```
[ ] Essential redirect and pipe operators
